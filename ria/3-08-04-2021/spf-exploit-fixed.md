## Report of Immediate Action
### Detailed Summary of executed Immediate Action
There was a critical vulnerability found by various users of Pocket, that was reported through Telegram. Email spoofing was possible, this meant, that an attacker was able to use a misconfiguration of our DMARC record to send emails as an user of the organization. 

### Evidence and Justification of the need for the Immediate Action:**
Shane received a message as hola@pokt.network, which showed custom text.
This could mean that anyone could potentially create a phishing attack on our users acting as if it was part of the organization.

### Timeline of the Immediate Action
May 1st 2021.

### Survey
- [X] Steps `CAN/WILL` be taken to avoid this Immediate Action in the future. Explain in detail below:

Even though our DKIM keys and SPF records were set correctly, our DMARC record was set with the flag `sp=none`, which meant that when a mail server received an email with invalid signature, it would go through to the client mail. Changing this flag to `sp=reject` was enough to fix this issue. Meaning that in the future, when a mail server receives an invalid signed email as a person from the organization, it will drop the message and the client won't receive the fake email.
