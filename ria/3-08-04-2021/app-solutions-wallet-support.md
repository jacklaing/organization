## Report of Immediate Action
### Detailed Summary of executed Immediate Action
Ecosystem suggested some explorer and wallet adjustments to be made on the run to avoid community members difficulties.

Those changes were executed by Pabel (PNI Apps Solution member), which contacted Support Engineering for the QA effort needed.

### Evidence and Justification of the need for the Immediate Action:**
The explorer and wallet issues were provoking hard community issues such as: balance tracking lost, user lack of trust in Pocket, lack of POKT movements, others; therefore the fixes were needed and justified, with them, the proper testing of those.
