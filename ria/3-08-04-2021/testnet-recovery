## Report of Immediate Action
### Detailed Summary of executed Immediate Action
Due to the 6.0 Relay To Tokens Multiplier issue, Testnet was rendered unusable to any >= 6.1 users. 
In order to mirror Mainnet, simulate the upgrade, and allow new nodes to nodes to sync, a recovery effort was immediately needed.
### Evidence and Justification of the need for the Immediate Action:**
Pocket Ecosystem and community rely on the Testnet and Faucet. Just in the few days Testnet was down we had an official need on the PNF side for 
Node Piolot and multiple community members attempt to sync without success.
