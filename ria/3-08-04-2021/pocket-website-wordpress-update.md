## Report of Immediate Action
### Detailed Summary of executed Immediate Action
As per requeted by Valeria Benitez, from the Pocket Ecosystem team, I updated and upgraded the https://pokt.network website, who's currently running using the stack provided by Bitnami. In this RIA, I updated the stack of:
- Wordpress to version 5.7.1.
- PHP to version 8.0.3

### Evidence and Justification of the need for the Immediate Action:**
Per security measures, we should upgrade constantly and periodically every system that it's currently being used by us, always taking in mind that it's from a stable version and it doesn't conflict with other systems version that are in use in our environment.
