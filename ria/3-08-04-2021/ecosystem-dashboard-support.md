## Report of Immediate Action
### Detailed Summary of executed Immediate Action
Ecosystem (Valeria and Enrrique) are working on the latest dashboard fixes, re-design and adjustments. In these days the Ecosystem have been meeting with Support Engineering to explain superficial details of the incoming Dashboard changes to be live. 

Dashboard changes were live on 06/04/2021, pushed by Enrrique.

Valeria shared several requirements and met with Support Engineering to discuss them as a walkthrough so that it's clear when QA gets to be executed.

In this process, we are not considering nor working on QA designs and proper execution. But, QA Adhoc testing will be executed against the dashboard, based on the provided requirements (https://www.notion.so/pocketnetwork/Testing-Protocol-7829dc5ab9ea446b90f4a687059aa66f) and general QA guidelines.

### Evidence and Justification of the need for the Immediate Action:**
Dashboard have been redesigned and reworked, making it more interesting and attractive for applications. At the moment, the focus of Ecosystem - Pocket, it's to bring in more APPs to request relays in the network, and the dashboard plays an important role in this Key Result or OKR.
