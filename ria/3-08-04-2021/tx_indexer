## Report of Immediate Action
### Detailed Summary of executed Immediate Action
Tendermint's default TxIndexer paginates
and sorts transactions during time of query, resulting in a large consumption of resources. Tendermint's default TxIndexer
also relies on events to index transactions, and due to a bug in RC-0.5.X pocket core module events are all concatenated
together. This makes indexing a nightmare.
### Evidence and Justification of the need for the Immediate Action:**
Multiple Community members who are trying to build good tooling on top of Pocket (Overlord, Kytrie, AndrewNguyen22) all rely on 
a consistent indexing of transactions and have made formal complaints / issues on the matter.
