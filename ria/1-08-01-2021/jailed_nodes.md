### General Notes
This RIA was partially solved by the actions described above. Completion of the [Network Fix Milestone](../../milestones/1-08-01-2021/network_fix/network_fix.md) solved this RIA in its entirety.

Nodes 13, 16 and 18 could not peer with other nodes, causing them to not be able to sync. After the `Network Fix` milestone completion, this issue was solved.
