[Detailed Description]
## Decision
### Detailed Summary of Topic
Should PNI use Discord or Slack for internal communication?

1) Keep Slack
2) Discord in Separate Server
3) Discord in Current Server (with community)
### Discussion Notes
- Andrew: "(a separate discord server) would allow us to maintain an independent, secure, and free-flowing collaboration effort
- Otto: Honestly the approach of having a separated discord server seem to me like a great way to be near the community (one click away of switching servers) and more controlled/private space for us. But at the same time i get the alerts and such are better integrated with slack, seems like we can do some laboratory experiments to see if that would work with us, also heard from someone that there is a discord / slack bridge that could be a middle ground solution
- Lowell: (private discord server) has more privacy security than other i think is a point to verify. For me i love slack but i also understand the issue points so i kinda open for both proposals
- Emanuel: I agree on being on Discord, even if it’s a separate server, but within the same condo. So I agree with it and I think it’ll be a win-win.
- Luis: but in this case, we are more productive to the ecosystem by being with the community, transferring knowledge, getting knowledge and feedback and so on
- Pabel: I agree with Otto, it will be easier for us to navigate since the actual pocket discord is full of channels, I got no problem changing to discord, it is a matter of adaptation.
