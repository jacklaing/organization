### Project Purpose
Perform a Pocket Network simulation with the following characteristics:

1. 5,000 Validator Nodes
2. 100M Relays per day (~4166666.66 per hour)

This tests ensures the reliability and scalability of the Pocket Network.

### Key Goals Of Project
1. Define and document the target scalability goals, testing conditions and environment factors.
2. Perform a succesful simulation of the Pocket Network, concluding with a full Claim/Proof cycle.
3. Document the results.
